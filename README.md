General project description:
This project enables the creation and management of properties, each with it's own balance, records and monthly reports.
Assumptions/Shortages:
- Records are only being created on the current time(no future or past creation of records is supported at this time).
- tests are missing due to time constraints.
- validations are missing due to time constraints.
- The react part of the app is completely unused, no need to review it.
